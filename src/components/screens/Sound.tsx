			<a href='https://noshell.teresapelinski.com/'>project website</a> <br />
			In 2021, I did a residency at Phonos Foundation, where I worked on my project <a href='https://noshell.teresapelinski.com/'>'no shell, just a voice'</a>. The sound pieces were released in
			the Phonos netlabel (<a href='https://phonosbcn.bandcamp.com/album/no-shell-just-a-voice'>Bandcamp</a>) and on a <a href='https://noshell.teresapelinski.com/'>webzine</a>. 'No Shell, Just
			a Voice' is a project that reflects on artificially generated voices that appear to have a _ghost_ but have no shell, no body.
			{/* <div>
				I generated the artificial voice in 'No Shell, Just a Voice' using a couple of hours of my dad's field recordings and WaveNet, a neural audio synthesis deep learning model. My dad,
				Ramón Pelinski, was an ethnomusicologist, and he studied the sword dance at La Todolella, a small village close to Castellón, in eastern Spain. In these tapes, recorded during the 90s,
				he interviews the old and the young who inhabit La Todolella, and asks them about how their lives have changed over time and how cultural identity is represented through music. I found
				these tapes in a wooden mountain of boxes in his office. My dad does not live anymore, and I wonder if these tapes will ever be listened to again. Will someone just throw them away
				when I die? In the process of digitalizing the recordings, I listened Todolellanos' voices and a voice I had long not heard, my dad's. This project is about many things, but mainly
				about listening. I feel the warmth of my dad's voice, and recognize some of the Todolellanos' voices – I met some of them when I was a kid. And I wonder who am I listening to when I
				listen to the artificial voice. Do voices always point to someone? Can they point to more than one person? I discuss the question of the body in artificial voices considering Mladen
				Dolar, Michel Chion and Pierre Schaeffer's accounts on the voice in the webzine accompanying this work (<a href='https://noshell.teresapelinski.com/'>NoShell.TeresaPelinski.com</a>).
				The first track is an archive (dataset) sample. The second track is the generated voice. Finally, the last track collects the algorithm-generated voices during training in ascending
				order (i.e., the algorithm learns to speak as the track evolves).

			In 2019, I started a record label and distro where I have co-edited a couple of vinyl releases. It's mainly post hxc and screamo music. The label was born with the idea of selling records
			at gigs in Madrid, where there was a great scene at the time. Then the pandemic hit and I moved to the UK on a plane, so most of my records are still back in Spain. The label might
			continue to die, or relive if I finally discover the very well hidden London screamo scene, or might be repurposed for my own musical ventures..... in any case please buy records from me,
			I really don't need N copies of the same record.
