			at the <a href='https://instrumentslab.org/'>Augmented Instruments Lab</a> at the Centre for Digital Music, based at Queen Mary University of London. My PhD is funded under the UKRI AI and
			Music CDT. In collaboration with <a href='https://bela.io/'>Bela</a> and under the supervision of <a href='https://andrewmcpherson.org/'>Prof. Andrew McPherson</a> (Imperial College
			London) and <a href='https://researchers.arts.ac.uk/1594-rebecca-fiebrink'>Prof. Rebecca Fiebrink</a>
			(University of the Arts London), I'm working on tools for prototyping with machine learning models on embedded systems in the context of musical instrument design. I'm also interested in
			practice research. Due to my supervisor's affiliations I also have a visiting researcher status at Imperial College London and University of the Arts London.

			Previously, I got my BSc Physics from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid. I learned lots of maths and a bit of code, and I became interested in sound. I spent a year at RWTH Aachen

			</a>{' '}
			in Sound and Music Computing (MSc) at the <a href='https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/'>Music Technology Group</a>, based in Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, and wrote my master thesis on
			using deep learning to generate drum loops.
			<br />
			<br />
			Besides my main activity, which is sitting on my desk doing my PhD, I am involved in very-casual{' '}
