-   Currently writing my PhD thesis. I expect to submit it in late spring and to do my PhD viva (defence) in summer. My UK visa will expire after that so in spring I'll start looking for roles in Canada (Montreal/Toronto area).
-   In November I started a Research Fellow part-time role at the [Music & Artificial Intelligence: Building Critical Interdisciplinary Studies](https://musicairesearch.wordpress.com/) (MusAI) ERC project, led by [Prof Georgina Born](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/15934-georgina-born). I'm working on the "Prototyping Radically Interdisciplinary Music AI Pedagogies" work package, led by [Prof Rebecca Fiebrink](https://researchers.arts.ac.uk/1594-rebecca-fiebrink) at the [Creative Computing Institute](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute). I'm very excited about this first post-doc role as it allows me to continue working on the STS angle of music technology that I've very much enjoyed during my thesis.
-   In September I submitted my last PhD journal paper (fingers crossed!) on my collaboration with [Adam Pultz Melbye](https://www.adampultz.com/about.html), more info in the [project page]('/projects'). [Update: it's been accepted!! will release a preprint soon]
-   This last autumn semester I taught Coding for Digital Media at the [MSc Applied ML for Creatives](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/postgraduate/msc-applied-machine-learning-for-creatives) (Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts, London). I was also invited to teach a 4h class in the [MRes Creative Computing](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/postgraduate/mres-creative-computing) on STS and HCI.
-   Because my @qmul.ac.uk email account will expire at some point in the near future, I created a personal email account at hi@teresapelinski.com (do I present techy enough if my personal email account ends in @gmail.com?). I think it was wise not to attempt to self-host my email account; I'm using [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/mail/), the cheapest provider (£14.40/year, 10GB hosting) I could find that didn't look too dodgy.
